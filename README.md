## Projects

**Actionable Science in Conservation: Analyzing Knowledge Gaps, Barriers, and Resolutions**
- Aimed to better understand the types of knowledge that conservation practitioners need, are using, and are generating, in addition to understanding the limitations they face in accessing information and strategies they use to overcome these barriers.
- Transcripts were analyzed using co-occurrence matrices in R to reveal patterns in how different knowledge types interact.
